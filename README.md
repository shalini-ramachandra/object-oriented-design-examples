# Object Oriented Design Examples

Object Oriented Design Problems are very interesting because they give you the flexibility to think and design freely, but at the same time helps giving other people a glimpse into your coding style. 

These problems are a collection of various problem statements that are available in CTCI and across the internet

1. Call Center
2. Jukebox
3. Parking Lot
4. Online Book Reader
5. Jigsaw
6. Chat Server
7. Meeting Scheduler like Outlook

## 1. Call Center

### Problem Statement
_Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the maanger is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method `dispatchCall()` which assigns a call to the first avaialble employee._
